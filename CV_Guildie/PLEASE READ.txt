A online platform for managing and connecting non-profit and profit organizations. 
This is an early version of a comercial product. 
Please do not share or reveal this code for purposes other than evaluating my skills.

Framework -> CodeIgniter
Database -> mySql
Programing language -> Html, CSS , PHP, JavaScript, Java (not shown), Ajax
Design patterns -> MVC(model view controller),Minor patterns: singleton, observer, iterator 

My part in the project encompassed building the:

- DAO and VAO classes (libraries->package.dbms->simb.guildie.Vao and simb.guildie.Dao (except for the notification class))
- support libraries or services (libraries->package.bls->simb.guildie.organ)
- model classes which can be found in the models sub-directory
- controller classes (controllers->managment(Company and User _controller.php) and organization (Event and Milestone _controller.php))
- helped (backend and some frontend) with the view classes (event -> add/detail/overview.php), (milestone -> add/link/overview.php), 
  (project->add/detail,overview/table.php), (user->add/detail,index,overview.php)
- building the ER-model for the database and transforming it into a physical form (non normalized as of this version)

Again i emphasize, that this is an early version of a work in progress project, with some defunct and unorganized classes, and unfinished code.
Will be updated with the final version, when released.
